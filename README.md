# Score4
core4 is a modern, robust rendition of “Connect Four,” built with clean, maintainable code reflecting proven design principles. Two players alternate dropping tokens into a suspended grid, vying to connect four in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before their opponent. The result is fast-paced, strategic, and highly engaging gameplay.
